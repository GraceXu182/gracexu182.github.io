#### Overview

<p align="justify">In this work, we present new norm-based generalization bounds for compositionally sparse neural networks, such as convolutional networks. Our main contributions include deriving significantly tighter bounds for sparse networks without relying on weight sharing and demonstrating that good generalization can be achieved with weak dependence on network size. Our experiments confirm that these bounds outperform existing ones, emphasizing the importance of network architecture on test performance. 
<b><span style="color: darkred">This work sheds light on why certain architectures excel, suggesting that sparsity is a key factor in their success</span></b>.
